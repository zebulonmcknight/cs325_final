**CS_325 Dog Breed Identification Final Project**

_Developer Setup Steps:_

1. First, clone this repo into a clean directory.

2. Retrieve data from Kaggle. Visit this link:
  
   https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification/data

   or use this command in your shell:
   
   kaggle competitions download -c dog-breed-identification

   DO NOT COMMIT ANY DATA (Compressed or Not) TO THE REPO. THIS WOULD REQUIRE GIT LARGE FILE STORAGE
 
5. Data will be downloaded as a zip file, unzip this file into a subdirectory called _data_.

   Your final directory should resemble: cs325_final/data/.  All code will be developed assuming this file structure.

6. You should create a .venv virtual environment for developing this project. VSCode will prompt you to create one
   when you first try to run a cell in the jupyter notebook. Python version 3.13.5 is the standard.

7. You'll need to setup dependencies in your .venv as well. View requirements.txt for project requirements.
